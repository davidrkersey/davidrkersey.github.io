I am a MS Business Analytics student in the Mason School of Business at The College of William and Mary. I am also an incoming Analytics Consultant at Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory in Washington, D.C. This website serves as a repository of projects I want to exhibit as I embark on my data science career.
